    title: The Ultimate Remix
    narrative: "This jacket's been through three decades of music history. We've reinforced the seams, fixed a torn pocket, and added our own Loop patch. The collection of patches stays - each one's a passport stamp from its life."
  - date: "2015 - Brighton"
    title: The Seaside Years
    narrative: "Found at a car boot sale by Priya, who wore it to every indie gig on the south coast. Added a \"Save The Planet\" patch (how fitting for its future with Loop!)."
  - date: "2005 - Berlin"
    title: The European Adventure
    narrative: "Travelled to Germany in a backpacker's rucksack. Spent five years in Berlin's club scene, collecting vintage pins and good vibes. Added a peace sign patch during a festival."
  - date: "1996 - Seattle"
    title: The Grunge Chapter
    narrative: "Picked up at a garage sale by Marcus, a coffee shop barista with excellent taste. Added a Nirvana patch and wore it to three actual concerts. Kurt would've approved."
  - date: "1989 - Los Angeles"
    title: The Birth of Cool
    narrative: "Bought from a Levi's store on Melrose Avenue by Cindy, who was definitely going to start a band. She added the first patch - a Guns N' Roses logo that's still there, faded but defiant."
